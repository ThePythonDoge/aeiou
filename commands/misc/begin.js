#Welcome to plants!
Plants is an idling game built into Aeiou to help you grow a flower.
To begin, you need to collect a seed. This can be done with <!dig> every few hours, or by reacting to messages with 'ðŸŒ°' when Aeiou does every so often.
Once you've collected a seed, you can view it with <!seeds>.

Now, plant your seed with <!plant [seed number]>, water your plant (or your friends!) with <!water>, and wait for it to grow!
Once it's fully grown, you can harvest it with <!harvest>.

See the full list of commands avilable with <!help>, under "Plant commands".
