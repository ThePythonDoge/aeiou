# aeiou
Aeiou is a general purpose Discord bot, like many others. It is in active development, and is also having an identity crisis as to what it wants to be.

# How to install?
Be sure to have a localhost:3306 MySQL server running. Remove the `.template` from secure.template.json and settings.template.sqlite3. Lastly, fill in secure.json with your actual values.

# How can I contribute? 
Submit a pull request, but really I don't see why you would want to.

# How can I invite aeiou to my server?
